# SFML-SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders introduced me to the application of object-oriented programming, with many game objects in the form of the many aliens on screen at the same time along with the player’s laser gun; these objects are incorporated into a dynamically assigned array to ensure code maintainability. This worksheet game project was crucial into my understanding of object-oriented programming and it’s use cases.
